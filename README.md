- Welcome to the MISI group git library
- Each project area has its own repo - please only edit code in repos related to your project.
- When working on code from this library - please download a local copy to work on that and only push changes to git with notification to all others working on that section of the code base.
- The intention is that this repo will host functional and completed code only - NOT WORKING COPIES.
- This library will inevitably contain code for different languages and formats (MATLAB, LABVIEW, C++ etc.), please adhere to best practices for the language you are working in.
- Where code has user-created dependencies (ie sub-vis or seperate function scripts) please ensure that those dependencies are included in the repo for that project.
- Please write a README for each repo and update it as necessary.
